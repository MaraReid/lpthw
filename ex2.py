# A comment, this is how you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.
print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored
# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."
print "This will run."

print "Learn python the hard way lesson 2 is easy."
# this is just a test
print 'This is "not" a test.'
# This may not run
# print "This won't run either."
